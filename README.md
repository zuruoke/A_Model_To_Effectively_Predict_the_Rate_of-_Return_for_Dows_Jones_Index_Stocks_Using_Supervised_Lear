A Model To Effectively Predict the Rate of Return for Dows Jones Index Stocks Using Supervised Learning

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is an index that tracks 30 large, 
publicly-owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ
and is one of the oldest, single most-watched indices in the world. 
To investors, the Dow Jones is defined as a collection of blue-chip companies with consistently stable earnings that include Walt Disney Company, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation.
When the TV networks say "the market is up today," they are generally referring to the Dow.

I'll be working with a data set that consist of collection of data over some period of week ,each record (row) is data for a week. 
Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price)


In this project, I'll:

1. Prepare the data for machine learning

2. Use PCA Model, an unsupervised learning algorithm for selecting relevant features

3. Train a model using Regressor model

4. Measure the accuracy of the model using rmse and mse
